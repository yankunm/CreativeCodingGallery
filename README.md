# Yankun's Creative Coding Gallery

My definition of creative coding refers to using programming to create art or tools that are visually engaging. The artworks have to be **Aesthetically Appealing** and **Techincally Complex** to satisfy as a great work.

This repo contains all digital artworks I created primarily using ***p5.js* in support of the [Processing](https://processing.org/) Foundation** and the various modules it offers. I also explore other advanced tools including **OpenGL** and its successor **WebGPU**, 3D libraries like **Three.js**, and various shading languages.

*Note: This gallery started in Fall 2023 is constantly being updated*
